### Angular & Rails Decoupled

This is a test app on how to wire up Ruby on Rails as a decoupled API with a front end in angular.

After cloning, run rake db:create, db:migrate, db:seed in the /server directory and start the rails app.

Run a simple python server on the /client directory (python -m SimpleHTTPServer)
